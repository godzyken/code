The service provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface that lets you synthesize written text into natural-sounding speech in a variety of languages, accents, and voices.
The service currently synthesizes text from English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, or Brazilian Portuguese into audio spoken in a male or female voice (the service supports only a single gender for some languages).
